# Intermediate Git and GitHub

## Assumed knowledge

In this course, we assume familiarity with the following Git commands and GitHub concepts:

* `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `log`
* Issues
* Pull requests (PRs)

If these are new to you then please join the
[*Introduction to Git and GitHub for Beginners* course][1], which is running in parallel.
